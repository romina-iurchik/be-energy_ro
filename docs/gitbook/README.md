# BeEnergy

**Decentralized peer-to-peer solar energy marketplace on Stellar.**

BeEnergy enables solar prosumer communities to track energy generation, trade energy credits (HDROP tokens), and participate in community yield programs through DeFindex vaults.

## What is BeEnergy?

BeEnergy bridges the physical world of solar panels with the Stellar blockchain:

* **Physical layer:** Solar panels → Inverter → Smart meter → Power grid
* **Digital layer:** API → Soroban Smart Contracts → HDROP Tokens → Marketplace

Each **1 HDROP = 1 kWh** of solar energy generated and injected into the grid.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **HDROP Tokens** | 1 token = 1 kWh, SEP-41 standard, automatic minting |
| **P2P Marketplace** | Create and buy energy offers with XLM |
| **Community Distribution** | Automatic proportional token distribution via smart contract |
| **Yield Farming** | DeFindex vaults for yield on deposited tokens |
| **Governance** | Community proposals (in development) |

## Tech Stack
