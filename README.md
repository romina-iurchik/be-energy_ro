BeEnergy enables neighbors to tokenize and trade solar energy directly, bypassing centralized utilities. Built for cooperative housing communities with shared solar infrastructure.

---

## The Problem

Communities worldwide are adopting solar panels, but:
- 🔴 Centralized utilities charge unpredictable rates
- 🔴 Zero transparency in energy distribution  
- 🔴 No way to monetize surplus generation
- 🔴 High fees for P2P energy sharing

## The Solution

BeEnergy creates **local energy marketplaces** where:
- ✅ Homes tokenize solar generation as **HoneyDrops (HDROP)** — 1 kWh = 1 token
- ✅ Neighbors trade energy directly using **Stellar blockchain**
- ✅ Smart contracts ensure **transparent, fair distribution**
- ✅ Communities gain **energy independence**

**Target:** Cooperative housing communities (3-10 homes per "Hive") in Spain, Latin America, and beyond.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Soroban)

**Deployed on Stellar Testnet:**

| Contract | Address | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `energy_token` | `CD7W5YHA...T3ZL` | HDROP token (SEP-41) with mint/burn |
| `energy_distribution` | `CD3LXNS5...G6QK` | Multi-sig energy distribution |
| `community_governance` | `CBKUWQZ2...WPDM` | On-chain voting system |

Built with **OpenZeppelin Stellar** for security and **Soroban SDK 23.1.0**.

Full addresses in `.env.example`.

### Frontend

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Wallet:** Freighter integration via Stellar Wallets Kit
- **UI:** Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (automatic from `main` branch)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v22+ (we use v22 for Corepack compatibility)
- **npm** v10+ (comes with Node)
- **Rust** + Cargo (for contracts)
- **Windows only:** Visual Studio Build Tools with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload
   Required to compile native Rust dependencies (e.g., to run `cargo test`).
   → [Download installer](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe) (~3-6 GB)
   After installing, restart your terminal before running any Rust commands.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuenDia-Builders/be-energy.git
cd be-energy
npm install
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:3000`

### Build Contracts

```bash
cd apps/contracts
stellar contract build
```

Outputs: `target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.wasm`
