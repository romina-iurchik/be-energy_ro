BeEnergy is a cooperative management dashboard + on-chain certification infrastructure for renewable energy on Stellar. Cooperatives use the dashboard to manage members, meters, readings, and statistics — and BeEnergy tokenizes their production as proto-certificates sold to external buyers (companies, ESG funds, climate programs).

---

## What it does

Two things:

1. **Cooperative management dashboard** — Web panel where cooperatives manage members, meters, generation statistics, and certificates.
2. **On-chain certification** — Tokenizes renewable production as proto-certificates on Stellar (1 token = 1 kWh), sold to external buyers.

```
Smart meter sends readings via API (POST /api/meters/readings)
        |
BeEnergy mints proto-certificates on-chain (1 token = 1 kWh)
        |
External buyer purchases certificates
        |
Buyer retires certificate (burn on-chain)
```

Each token is a **proto-certificate**: a verifiable on-chain claim that 1 kWh of renewable energy was generated. It is not a financial instrument, not electricity for consumption, and not designed for trading between members.

## Smart Contracts (Soroban)

Deployed on Stellar Testnet:

| Contract | Address | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `energy_token` | [`CCYOVOFD...MRPBA6`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCYOVOFDJ5BVBSI6HADLWETTUF3BU423MEAWBSBWV2X5UVNKSJMRPBA6) | SEP-41 fungible token representing renewable generation certificates |
| `energy_distribution` | [`CBTDPLFN...NX2UDZ`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CBTDPLFNFGWVOD4HXDKW4EH5L3D2YGOY5CWTFCJM5TEWFL4VQTNX2UDZ) | Allocates certificates to cooperative members by participation |
| `community_governance` | [`CCH2EXXN...BJD6YI`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCH2EXXNSDW2BAKBIPFAG6CCZS6LV4VJFUP2CZZCW5LEY4JOAXBJD6YI) | Cooperative governance (proposals) |

Built with **OpenZeppelin Stellar v0.5.1** (Pausable + Upgradeable) and **Soroban SDK 23.1.0**.

65 tests passing. See [docs/CONTRACTS.md](docs/CONTRACTS.md) for full reference.
